                    The leader in my field is a Principal Software Engineer. This role is an individual contributor
                    position however it is also in the same level as a Director so it is a technical leadership
                    position. These technical leaders are consulted by various stakeholders including leadership,
                    program management, product owners, and other staff level engineers. Each stakeholder needs a
                    different type of output from a Principal Engineer, leaders need to understand how to get things
                    done within timelines and budget, engineers need help solving the most demanding technical
                    challenges. This is a dynamic role where the leader has to adapt their message to their audience and
                    at the same time is still individually contributing to the organization.

                    A high degree of fidelity is needed within the context of personal and professional organization for
                    a principal engineer. To be most effective I need to organize knowledge in a personal organization
                    structure where I can adapt to different contexts or stakeholders. I'll also be working on many
                    projects in parallel so I need to quickly context switch and have a personal system to keep me
                    successful. It will also be incumbent of me to become an expert at managing knowledge with the
                    various stakeholders mentioned above. This can take the shape of technical designs for engineers and
                    system maintenance cost management reports for other leaders. The breadth of demand for the
                    organizational skills of a principal engineer is incredibly high.

                    strong. An area of improvement for me is the varied professional organization techniques, I should
                    become better at skills like business process modeling language (BPMN), techniques for observability
                    engineering and finding formats and forums to present my findings.

          <h5 class="display-8">Concept & Illustrating Artifacts</h5>
          <p>
            A critical component of a Principal Software Engineer is personal organization. I need an excellent command
            at organizing information. As a highly technical contributor working on high-leverage tasks within an
            engineering organization, I will receive a high volume of complex information from various sources. Within
            the first module of our course, we focus on the critically acclaimed method of getting-things-done (GTD) by
            David Allen. The actual technique of GTD is beyond what we could cover in the class, we skip over a few
            pre-requisite topics of Defining our purpose and principles, and Outcome visioning. Instead, our exercise is
            in Brainstorming part of the natural project planning process. The mind sweep is an exercise where a
            facilitator reads out words from a variety of different concerns within our lives, and the exercise is to
            write down without judgement, different tasks or project ideas that for one reason or another you keep
            forgetting are a priority. This process continues for a period of about 15 minutes where the participant
            attempts to capture all projects that are holding our attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the mind sweep exercise, we have a list of ideas that we need to Organize. In the GTD method there is
            a very simple model for task organization, we can store our tasks in a few different places like a Next
            Action list, Someday Maybe, or a Waiting For list. There are other areas too like a variety of Context
            lists, for example I may have one called Boss â€“ One on One and it's a contextual list of tasks or projects
            that I want to discuss with my boss during a one on one.
          </p>

          <h5 class="display-8">Reflection on how this knowledge and skills will help you become a good leader</h5>
          <p>
            This is the extent of the mind weep assignment from this class, however the fundamental concept that is
            critical for my career goal of becoming a principal engineer extends beyond this. Task management is a
            critical skill, it is often a challenge if I am trying track a dozen or so conversations and small one-off
            ad-hoc requests at work, having a system like GTD is critical to continue to advance my career. I think GTD
            is a good system, however I have already started to grow beyond this one system, task management is one
            component of a concept that I would consider knowledge management. There is a concept known as the <a
              target="_blank" href="https://zettelkasten.de/overview/">Zettelkasten Method</a>. The way I view GTD is
            task management, and task management is a subset of knowledge management. This entire term I have been
            trying to organize my notes and tasks using an open-source tool called <a target="_blank"
              href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a>. Logseq has within it functionality for doing task management, so
            one could say I have implemented GTD within Logseq and the Zettelkasten method.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example of the benefit of a knowledge management technique refer to my knowledge graph from this term.
            As I'm taking notes and action items, I'm iteratively building out a knowledge graph that I can refer to
            later. I believe I am reaping the benefits of the personal organization concepts taught in module 1 through
            this example.
          </p>

          <h5 class="display-8">Plan for getting there</h5>
          <p>
            I want to continue to use Logseq and the Zettelkasten method to really become an expert at knowledge
            management concepts. I think this expertise will come with consistent practice, so my goal is to daily have
            the tool open and capture my notes and tasks.

          <h3 class="display-6 text-center"><em>Artifact 2</em> Personal Email Evaluation</h3>
          <h5 class="display-8">Concept & Illustrating Artifacts</h5>
          <p>
            We extend the concept of personal organization to professional organization especially in a workplace when
            the content being organized is collaborative with other individuals. Email is the premiere example of
            collaborative knowledge in the digital age and therefore we can start our focus with reviewing our
            organization and approach to email. We can apply the teachings from David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD)
            methods to email. In GTD, Allen suggests that we should strive for zero-inbox a goal state where there are
            no emails left in our inbox. Email is an inbox our goal should be to empty it, but Allen draws a distinction
            between emptying the inbox and taking all required action within the emails. There is an organization
            technique where we can separate organizing our inbox and the result will be zero-inbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technique that Allen describes to achieve a zero-inbox is as follows. Delete emails that we don't need,
            complete any action on an email if you can do so within two minutes. The remaining emails that need to be
            filed then fall into two categories, emails that require action from me, or emails where I'm waiting for
            someone or something else to proceed. Here we introduce the GTD folders like @Action, @WaitingFor, and
            @Context_Topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did follow this process for both my personal and school emails and have achieved zero-inbox
          </p>

          <h5 class="display-8">Reflection on how this knowledge and skills will help you become a good leader</h5>
          <p>
            Personally, I have extended my email organization beyond zero-inbox. I have devised a system where I can
            actually block individual senders from contacting me which will protect me from identity theft and spam if
            my email address is leaked. I have a technique where I leverage email-aliases to give each contact a unique
            email address to contact me. If a party leaks my email address, I can delete that specific email address,
            and my inbox will remain clean. I can't realistically apply this approach professionally; however, this is
            illustrative of the lengths I will go to maintain knowledge hygiene.
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the workplace emails represent people discussing projects. Being responsive to emails where I need to act
            is critical while approaching the role of Principal Engineer. When someone is requesting my assistance
            through email I should respond within a timely fashion. I already have a personal goal of responding to any
            email directed toward me within the same business day and I wish to continue this process going forward. It
            would be great if I could achieve and maintain zero-inbox professionally.
          </p>

          <h5 class="display-8">Plan for getting there</h5>
          <p>
            Professionally I have a few unique challenges achieving inbox-zero. The first challenge is automated emails,
            automated systems can sometimes spam many emails and it's a challenge to deal with. The technique I have
            always used was to have a rule in outlook that determines the sender or subject line and moves those emails
            to a particular folder. In our course discussion a classmate gave me an alternative idea that I plan to
            implement, instead of simply moving these emails to another folder I should have the rule deleting the
            email. I ignore most of these emails anyway so there is no value in them slowing down my email client. This
            idea also is congruent with Allen's idea from <a target="_blank"
              href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/GettingEmail.pdf">"Getting Email"</a> a
            course reading "The ease with which we trash things from our physical mail doesn't seem to translate to the
            computer for many people".
          </p>
          <p>
            The next challenge I have in achieving zero-inbox is the volume of emails I do receive professional is
            large, and even if in the moment I donâ€™t think they are valuable sometimes in the long term they are
            critical to go back and refer to, to address this I can at least do a better job of filing emails by topic
            and otherwise archiving potentially useful information into my Zettelkasten knowledge management system.
