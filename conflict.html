                                        Since the technical leader of a principal engineer is tasked with some of the
                                        highest leverage technical decisions, conflict is unavoidable. The stakes are
                                        increased beyond that which a staff-level engineer is faced with. The impact of
                                        this leader making a wrong decision can be detrimental to the entire company. It
                                        is this leader's responsibility though to lead through conflict and find ways to
                                        deal with the difficult people around us.

                                        I personally still struggle with the real negative aspects of conflict at work.
                                        I am not alone though; this will likely always be a component of conflict for me
                                        but finding healthy ways to cope with the stress and proceed is the goal of
                                        being an effective Principal Engineer.

                    <p>
                        Throughout the term, the graduate students had the opportunity to lead a book study on a topic
                        related to leadership and career success. The main reason I chose to take this course is my
                        interest in dealing with difficult people and conflict. In my book study we read “Getting Along
                        – How to work with anyone (even difficult people)” by Amy Gallo. The book is divided into three
                        sections which fit nicely with the book club meetings. In the first section Gallo lays out the
                        groundwork for getting along, we analyze reasons why workplace conflict impacts us so greatly as
                        well as the importance of workplace relationships despite some people being difficult to work
                        with. In section two, Gallo introduces several archetypes that difficult people assume, for each
                        archetype we analyze why this behavior may be present and learning coping strategies for dealing
                        with these difficult individuals. In the final section of the book, we learn different
                        strategies for protecting ourselves when our attempts at working with difficult individuals are
                        unsuccessful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My book study met on a zoom meeting one time at the start of the term to discuss the first
                        section, following sections were only discussed through our canvas group. My group member had
                        interesting insights, and I kept her examples in mind as I prepared my presentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My contribution to the presentation is combining the book learning, course content, and my own
                        personal experiences into what is hopefully an insightful and engaging presentation. See the
                        embed link below for the presentation.

                <h5 class="display-8">Reflection on how this knowledge and skills will help you become a good leader
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The decomposition of conflict and emotional intelligence that I outline in my presentation I believe
                    is a useful technique for dealing with the stress of interacting with difficult people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My naive approach for dealing with difficult people includes internalizing stress, instead with the
                    learning from this term I can consider the different components of this conflict. For example, when
                    I analyze a stressful situation at work, I can better differentiate my self-awareness – how I
                    observe my frustration, and self-management – how I respond to the conflict. This is a very healthy
                    and constructive device for navigating my career and the stresses that will present themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One area that I believe is still incumbent of me to improve is acting on my social-awareness with
                    relationship-management skills. I often will notice how a group or individual responds to a
                    situation, however I rarely let that observation inform how I respond. As a leader I need to have
                    more concern for others’ issues.
                </p>

                <h5 class="display-8">Plan for getting there</h5>
                <p>
                    In the abstract sense when I am in conflict with an individual at work, I should use my
                    social-awareness more clearly to inform my reaction. My plan is to be more accommodating, if what
                    they are requesting is within my ability to provide then I should, however if they are requesting
                    something that I cannot accommodate then instead of staying in conflict I should instead approach
                    the conflict. Instead of trying to convince the person I am in conflict with I ought to try and
                    better understand their issue and see if I can find an alternative solution that is a win-win for
                    both of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to focus on this for at least the next month and I hope this intention will put me on the
                    path for further growth throughout my career.

                        Discussion</h3>
                    <h5 class="display-8">Concept & Illustrating Artifacts</h5>
                    <p>
                        During Module 4 we had an assignment titled “Emotional Intelligence Case Studies”. Each member
                        of our group was tasked with considering a few scenarios where there was conflict, and we played
                        the role of the leader in an attempt to resolve the conflict. I won't share the discussion here
                        since this website is public, but I would recommend those with access to the canvas discussion
                        to review it. The case study I choose to analyze was a conflict between CiCi and Daisy who work
                        in our customer service department. There is a training that CiCi prepares, but Daisy is not
                        able to follow the format of the training. The situation escalates with some gossiping and is
                        articulated by Daisy leaving work abruptly citing the stress of the incident. The objective of
                        the case study is to find a way to lead CiCi and Daisy to reconcile their differences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our group discussion it was interesting discussing with Erin and Luis. Erin and I both
                        addressed this prompt but in different ways. Luis was interested enough in our responses to read
                        this prompt in addition to the prompt he had responded to!
                    </p>



                    <h5 class="display-8">Reflection on how this knowledge and skills will help you become a good leader
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Given the facts of the case study, I believe my approach of separating the case study into two
                        issues is productive. There was a substantive issue of the training which is not as effective as
                        the group wanted. There was also a culture issue which is more concerning to me of the gossiping
                        and effect on a team member to the point of leaving the workplace due to stress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really appreciated Erin's response and discussion too. I did not even consider that the task
                        that was assigned to CiCi may not yet have been within her grasp, and this may have exacerbated
                        the already weak relationship between her and Daisy. I think through this discussion I have
                        grown as a leader because my perspective is now broader regarding conflict in the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking my leadership in this area to the next level will require more successful examples like
                        we consider in the case study. It would be helpful to have more impactful substantive issues
                        though. Daisy leaving work due to a conflict is already a very extreme culture issue to respond
                        to.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="display-8">Plan for getting there</h5>
                    <p>
                        I am not in a position to take the role of the leader resolving an issue between two reports.
                        However, there are many conflicts that don't require that formal working relationship. I can
                        practice these techniques in my current role especially on high stakes substantive conflicts.
                        The next time I am facing a substantive conflict I can prepare my notes and gather data and
                        approach the conflict directly and seek change.
